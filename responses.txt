Dear John,

Thank you for your inquiry about Community Night. It is an event for ages 13 and up and includes 2 hours of combat archery for the price of one, without Nerf. Participants should arrive at 6:45 PM and can use either the party room or an available space. Games will be played on one court with teams and rotations, and the cost is $10 per person. 

While new participants are welcome, it is not recommended for beginners as they will be playing against regulars and coaches. It is better suited for those seeking a challenge and with a competitive spirit. There are small vending machine items available on-site, including water, Gatorade, and soda, and several pizza places are located nearby, within 5 minutes of the facility. Tablecloths are available in the Karaoke Party Room, including plastic table covers in black. Cutlery is also available in case of emergencies. The maximum capacity of the party room is 30 people, but it will be a tighter squeeze and people may need to stand up. Customers are allowed to bring their own alcohol, but they need to obtain a Special Occasion Permit, which can be easily obtained online. The permit process usually takes up to 10 days, but customers

It's recommended for those are seeking a challenge and with a competitive spirit. Participants should arrive at 6:45 PM and can use either the party room or an available space.

Alcohol can only be consumed in the Party Room and not in the Dining Room. The maximum capacity of the party room is 30 people, but it will be a tighter squeeze if the group exceeds 30 people. In such case, it is recommended to book the Dining Room. Tablecloths are available in the Karaoke Party Room, including plastic table covers in black. Cutlery is not provided but can be made available in an emergency.

I hope this helps.
